# Project-DIVA-f-f2nd

My GitHub project about modding *Project DIVA f 2nd* for the PS Vita.

As of writing this, none of this has been tested with PS3 data â€” it all refers to the PS Vita version only.

## Requisites  
- CFW PS Vita (HENkaku)

- `RePatch` plugin (**do not use `fd_fix`**)  
- Digital copy of *Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA f/f 2nd/X*  
  - If using the physical version, dump the cartridge using MaiDumpTool or a similar tool.
